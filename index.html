                The good graphics on the left here are known as "The Stevenheimer".  
                This hi-res representation also goes by "His Excellence", though 
                the full extent of his glory has yet to be unveiled.
                Until that time comes, we must bask in the glow that emanates, and 
                mayhaps if we grovel hard enough, he will grant us more content.

                But what glorious content he has provided us with thus far!  Who can 
                forget Fred Flintstone's battle cry of "Barney!" over and over again

                Then there's <i>Pac-Mental</i>.  That game's pretty cool.  It's about this yellow ball
                who drives these poor ghosts mad for no apparent reason!  Why is Pac-Mental such 
                a mean circle?  That's just how pops wanted it...

                Finally, there's the hosting platform these great games reside on:  <i>Stevester Enterprises,
                Ink.</i>  In 2017, "The Stevester", a subsidiary of "The Stevenheimer", trademarked <i>The No Spin Zone</i>
                in order to get slapped with litigation from Bill O'Reilly.  Unfortunately, that litigation never
