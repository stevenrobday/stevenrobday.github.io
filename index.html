                    The good graphics on the left here are known as
                    <i>The Stevenheimer</i>. This hi-res representation also goes by
                    <i>His Excellence</i>, though the full extent of his glory has yet to be unveiled. Until that time comes,
                    we must bask in the glow that emanates, and mayhaps if we grovel hard enough, he will grant us more content.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    But what glorious content he has provided us thus far! Who can forget Fred Flintstone's battle cry of "Barney!" over and
                    over as he clobbers those snivelling clones into death's sweet embrace in pursuit of his cherished bowl
                    of pebbles in the challenging, yet oddly satisfying,
                    <i>Fruity Pebbles: The Game</i>?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Then there's
                    <i>Pac-Mental</i>. That game's pretty cool. It's about this yellow ball who drives these poor ghosts mad
                    for no apparent reason! The story unfolds across three intermissions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, there's the hosting platform these great games reside on:
                    <i>Stevester Enterprises, Ink.
                    </i> In 2017,
                    <i>The Stevester</i>, a subsidiary of
                    <i>The Stevenheimer</i>, trademarked
                    <i>The No Spin Zone</i>
                    in order to get slapped with litigation from Bill O'Reilly. Unfortunately, that litigation never came...
